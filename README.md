# Homebrew Utils

This is a repository with utilities that I use for personal needs and which do not meet the requirements for a centralized homebrew repository.

## Usage

Tap the repo with:

```
brew tap szonov/utils
```

You can then install any formula.

## Formula listing

- Reindexer v4 `brew install reindexer@4`

## License
